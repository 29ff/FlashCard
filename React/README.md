## Node.js 
---

### What is [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) ?

* Node.js is a javascript runtime built on Chrome's V8 javascript engine. 
* Basically, Node gives you an environment to run your Javasscript code on 	  your machine, which was previously confined only to your browser.
* So, whatever you used to do using PHP or Python can now be done in    javascript using node.js.
* It helps you run your Web Server.

A simple example -

```
var http = require("http");

var server = http.createServer(function(req,res){
	console.log("Hello someone there?")
	res.write("Hey it's me !");
	res.end();
});

server.listen(3000);
```
